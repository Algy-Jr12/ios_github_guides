Click on your project, select your app target, press general, then add the framework you need. For example, MapKit.framework

## Using a linked Framework

### import

In every swift file you need to access the framework's methods and classes, you'll need to `import` the framework. For example, to use MKMapView in your MapViewController, `import MapKit`.

```Swift
import UIKit
import MapKit
import CoreLocation
import AddressBookUI
import MessageUI

class MapViewController: UIViewController{
    var mapView: MKMapView!
    â€¦
```

Now you can use Apple's frameworks!
