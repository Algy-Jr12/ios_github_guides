Xcode allows us to choose from 3 different modal transitions, Cover Vertical, Flip Horizontal and Cross Dissolve. Unfortunately, there is no provided way to adjust these stock transitions; they are what they are. Fortunately, we can create all types of cool custom transitions to fit all your app building needs using a few custom transition classes that we will provide.
