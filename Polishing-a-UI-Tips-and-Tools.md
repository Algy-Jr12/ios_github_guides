## Critical Guidelines


Be sure to pay attention to the following elements of beautiful visual design. The devil is in the details. Trust that small improvements can make a big difference on the overall experience. Prefer minimalism over too much noise:

 - **Colors.** Having three colors (One primary, one secondary, and one accent) used consistently through your app.
 - **Typography.** Using the correct sizes for different information to create a consistent visual hierarchy. Be cautious not to have too many different typo on a same page and UI guidelines!
 - **Iconography.** Icons should generally be a muted single-color (gray, faded colors) and not be too eye-catching unless they are actions or meant to draw attention.
 - **Spacing.** Make sure you to tighten up spacing of elements. Spacing on the top and bottom should be consistent. Pay attention to proper spacing between elements as well.
 - **Alignment.** Make sure elements are aligned to a grid. In other words, each view should be aligned to surrounding elements (i.e text to middle of image).
 - **Information.** Having multiple pieces of text that are all near each other in an item that are exactly the same size, color and style is usually not a good practice.
 - **Tabs.** Tabs should be consistent with the background color of the Toolbar above them.

 2. Pick a **Vibrant Color Scheme** - Pick a primary color and a secondary color for coloring your app, relying either on the [iOS color guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/color/) or on [Material Design colors](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#color-ui-color-application), using a [sensible color scheme](http://www.colourlovers.com/palettes/new/past-month/meta?page=1). Check out [material palette](http://www.materialpalette.com/) or the [coolors generator](https://coolors.co/) for other takes on picking colors.
 3. Use **Proper Icons and Colorful Images** - Use images, icons and backgrounds for your UIs leveraging resources like (iOS system icons)[https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/graphics/system-icons/], [TheNounProject](http://thenounproject.com/), [MaterialDesignIcons](http://materialdesignicons.com/), [IconFinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/), [iconmonstr](http://iconmonstr.com/), [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/search/), [Google Image Search](http://www.google.com/imghp) or create your own with a vector software like (Figma)[https://www.figma.com/]. For app icons, systems icons, custom icons, refer to the [iOS iconography style guidelines](http://developer.android.com/design/style/iconography.html)
 4. Review **Typography** - Check out the [iOS typography guide](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/typography/) to understand the common font type for iOS apps and default type colors and sizes. You can also find custom font libraries: (iOS font)[http://iosfonts.com/], (Swift custom font examples)[https://gist.github.com/cmoulton/f5640b2e75411d87df9b], (iOS library to programmatically load custom fonts)[https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/FontBlaster].
 5. Apply **backgrounds and borders** to views and layouts - Use [[shape and layer drawables]] cliffnotes to create colorful backgrounds and borders to your [[buttons]], [[listviews]], and other views. See the [[material card view]] for a look at modern styles for lists. // TO BE UPDATED FOR IOS
 6. Improve **ActionBar and Navigation Appearance** -  Review our style guides for the [[ActionBar]] and [[Tabs guide]]. See generators linked in next section. // TO BE UPDATED FOR IOS
 7. Follow **iOS UI Standards** - Use (iOS Human Interface Guidelines)[https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/].
