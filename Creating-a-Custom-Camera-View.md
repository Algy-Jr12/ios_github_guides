Accessing the built in Image Picker Controller is an easy and quick way to get image and video capture into your app. However, when you need style and functionality that goes beyond the stock Image Picker Controller you will need to create a Custom Camera View.

### Step 1: Set Up Views In Storyboard

Add the following view elements to the ViewController in Storyboard:
- **UIView** This will serve as the "view finder" of your camera.
- **UIImageView** This will hold the captured still image after you take a picture.
- **UIButton** This button will "take a picture".
