This is a tutorial that shows how to implement an app that display movies that are currently being played at theaters using the RottenTomatoes API

# The App
The app has two screens. The first screen "Movies" shows a list of movies, in which, each movie is described by its title, synopsis, and a poster thumbnail image. After a user selects a movie from the list, a second screen appears displaying additional details about the movie, including, the cast, and rating.
