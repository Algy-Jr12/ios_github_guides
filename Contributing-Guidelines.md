## Getting Started

If you want to contribute to the guides, you can [edit the wiki](https://github.com/codepath/ios_guides/wiki) directly.

## Guidelines

The guides philosophy is all about cutting down the content keeping the guides **clean and practical**. In particular:

 * **Don't** include long preambles, blocks of text or extensive vocabulary lessons
 * **Do** focus on the **practical** and be to-the-point
 * **Do** include screen captures and images that supplements the content 
 * **Do** discuss third-party open-source libraries that save you tons of time
 * **Do** put the code blocks first. **Always include practical code samples**
 * **Don't** use elaborate examples that take way too much time to understand.
 * **Do** mention the implications and practical conclusions you've made

## Principles

The most important thing is to **save people as much time as possible**. Include the maximum amount of useful code that we can in the smallest amount of space and 90% should be code in most cases. A few key principles to keep in mind:

 * Have short introductions that explain the reason why the concept matters
 * Always share references at the bottom of the guide that cites all sources
 * Feel free to use gists for large bodies of code you want to link to

## Missing Topics

Check the [issues](https://github.com/codepath/ios_guides/issues) for this repository to see what types of contributions would be most impactful. In particular, there is an [issue](https://github.com/codepath/ios_guides/issues/1) that contains the most important missing topics. Also look for items in the guides with the **Needs Attention** mark which indicates the guide needs some love.
