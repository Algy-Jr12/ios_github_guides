To run code on button events like touch down or touch up, switch to assistant mode to show the button side by side with the Swift view controller. Ctrl-drag from the button to the Swift file and create an action with the event that you want. You can create multiple actions for different events.

### Step 1: Turn on the Assistant Editor

### Step 2: Create the Action

Ctrl-drag from the button to the Swift file. Select Action (not Outlet) and select the event, which is usually Touch Up Inside.
